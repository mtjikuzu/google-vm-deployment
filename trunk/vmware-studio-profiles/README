These are appliance build profiles to be used with VMware Studio itself. Basic
information fields have been filled in, but site-specific fields such as
hostnames, usernames, passwords, etc. will need to be provided by you.

Be sure to validate the appliance build profile after modifying it.

During the appliance build phase, VMware Studio may report that the appliance
build has taken more than the required 30 minutes. If this is the case, consider
opening the build in VMware Server Console and inspecting the the virtual
terminals one through four. To make appliance deployment easiest for end-users,
some of the appliance profiles perform a package update, which may take a while
to finish. SEE: ALT + F2 and inputting ps to see if yum is running.

= appliance-builder-package-repository.xml

This build profile creates a semi-managed YUM repository server.

Do note that this appliance may require 15 gigabytes of disk space once it is
running. By default, it is small; but it has capacity to grow to house your
packages.
